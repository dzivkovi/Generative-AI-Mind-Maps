# LLM Use Cases

[Visualize Markdown as MindMap](https://markmap.js.org/repl)

## Why All the Excitement About Large Language Models?

1. English as the new Programming Language!
2. World knowledge (up to the training cutover date).
3. You don't need as many specialized/expensive AI/ML Engineers.
4. No need to re-train the foundation models for new tasks.
5. Use your domain knowledge to adapt LLMs to specific business tasks/domains.

## [What are LLMs good for?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aq7fnqzeaPc)

### Reduction Operations: Go from big to small

- Summarization
  - Say the same thing with fewer words.
  - Can use list, notes, executive summary.

- Distillation
  - Purify the underlying principles or facts.
  - Remove all the noise, extract axioms, foundations, etc.

- Extraction
  - Retrieve specific kinds of information.
  - Q&A, listing names, extracting dates, etc.

- Characterizing
  - Describe the content of the text.
  - Describe either the text as a whole, or within the subject.

- Analyzing
  - Find patterns or evaluate against a framework.
  - Structural analysis, rhetorical analysis, etc.

- Evaluation
  - Measuring, grading, or judging the content.
  - Grading papers, evaluating against morals.

- Critiquing
  - Provide feedback within the context of the text.
  - Provide recommendations for improvement

### Transformation Operations: Maintain size and/or meaning

- Reformatting
  - Change the presentation only.
  - Prose to screenplay, XML to JSON.

- Refactoring
  - Achieve same results with more efficiency.
  - Say the same exact thing, but differently.

- Language Change
  - Translate between languages.
  - English to Russian, C++ to Python.

- Restructuring
  - Optimize structure for logical flow, etc.
  - Change order, add or remove structure.

- Modification
  - Rewrite copy to achieve different intention.
  - Change tone, formality, diplomacy, style, etc.

- Clarification
  - Make something more comprehensible.
  - Embellish or more clearly articulate.

### Generation/Expansion Operations: Go from small to big

- Drafting
  - Generate a draft of some kind of document.
  - Code, fiction, legal copy, KB, science, storytelling.

- Planning
  - Given parameters, come up with plans.
  - Actions, projects, objectives, missions, constraints, context.

- Brainstorming
  - Ideation, exploration of possibilities, problem solving, hypothesizing.
  - Use "Imagine" to list out possibilities.

- Amplification
  - Articulate and explicate something further.
  - Expanding and expounding, riffing on stuff.

## What are the risks, misuses & limitations of LLMs?

- Data Leakage vulnerabilities
- Hallucination
  - Responses may sounds coherent & convincing but can be made up
- [Adversarial Prompting](https://www.promptingguide.ai/risks/adversarial)
  - Prompt Injection
  - Prompt Leaking
  - Jailbreaking
- [Bias and Toxicity](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall22/cos597G/lectures/lec14.pdf)
- Testing is hard
  - Non-deterministic LLM output

## [Generative AI Business Strategy](https://www.sectionschool.com/courses/generative-ai-business-strategy)

### AI Operating Modes

- Optimize ($): Make your internal efforts more efficient
- Accelerate ($$): Improve your current product or service
- Transform ($$$): Create a new product or service line

### 4 Step Process

1. *Choose your mode(s)*. Decide whether to use AI to optimize, accelerate, and/or transform your organization.
2. *Identify AI projects*. For each mode, brainstorm potential projects that use generative AI.
3. *Prioritize projects*. Evaluate these projects and decide which make sense to invest in.
4. *Get buy-in*. Build your AI project memo and get approval.

### Five Generative AI use cases

1. Generate text, code, images or video
   - Generate email copy
   - Blog posts
   - Video tutorials
   - Website product pages
   - Draft code
   - Translation

2. Process or synthesize text, code, images or video
   - Fraud detection
   - Content moderation
   - Audio file categorization
   - Product review summaries
   - Email categorization
   - Analyze data, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data quality & governance

3. Generate ideas
   - Thought partner
   - Brainstorming campaign, blog, or post ideas
   - Case study ideas

4. Complete tasks
   - Personal assistants
   - Functional assistants (marketing, sales, data)
   - App assistants (Windows, Google Sheets)

5. Interact with users
   - Customer service
   - Tutors
   - Therapists
   - Coaches

## [Pragrmatic Mindset to kickstarting *any* project](https://ben11kehoe.medium.com/serverless-is-a-state-of-mind-717ef2088b42)

- If the platform has it, use it
- If the market has it, buy it
- If you can reconsider requirements, do it
- If you have to build it, own it
